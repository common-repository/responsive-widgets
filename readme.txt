A collection of text/HTML widgets that display only on the devices specified for each.

== Description ==

Looking for widgets that display text, code, images or WordPress shortags only on a specific device? Then this plugin is for you!

#### How it works:

After installing Responsive Widgets plugin, browse to your WP dashboard, go to Appearance -> Widgets page and there you will see 
a whole bunch of new widgets titled to their specified device. Load up as many as you want in your favorite sidebar area to display
specific content on that specific device and no other.

You will notice that some devices may also reffer to similar devices as well. For instance the generic tablet widget will obviously display on all tablets, iPad, Android Samsung etc. That is why most widgets have checkboxes to toggle display on or off for conflicting devices. 
([See screenshots tab](http://wordpress.org/plugins/responsive-widgets/screenshots/))

These options are available everywhere that I could find a conflicting device where unwanted duplication may occur.
